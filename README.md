- 👋 Hi, I’m @maribelescandon
- 👀 I’m interested in public health, data storytelling, and making dashboards that actually *make sense*.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to have a better sleep schedule… and how not to open Excel “just to check something” at 11 PM.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that blend creativity, tech, and health — bonus points if it involves maps or messy datasets.
- 📫 How to reach me [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maribel-escandon/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve presented at national STI conferences *and* run a marathon — one was definitely more painful than the other 🏃‍♀️😅
